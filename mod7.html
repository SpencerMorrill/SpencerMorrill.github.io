      I have finished practicing with JavaScript via quizzes online and I have also moved on to do my own programming.
      Using the website "Code School" I have finished the basic learning path with JavaScript coding.
      I have even tried coding 3D VR images.
      I continue to use my knowledge by expanding my ability to code and continuing to experiment more in JavaScript.
