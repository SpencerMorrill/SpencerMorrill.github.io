      I have been practicing with JavaScript via quizzes online and now have also moved on to trying my own programming. Using the website "Code School" I have continued my learning with JavaScript coding. I have also experimented with JavaScript and changing up the style format of pages with the chrome developer tools. I continue to use my knowledge by expanding my knowledge and continuing to experiment more in JavaScript.
