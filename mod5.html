      I have finished practicing with JavaScript via quizzes online and I have also moved on to do my own programming.
      Using the website "Code School" I have finished the basic learning path with JavaScript coding.
      I have also tested codes with JavaScript and changing up the style format of pages with the chrome developer tools.
      I continue to use my knowledge by expanding my ability to code and continuing to experiment more in JavaScript.
      I even moved onto Stencyl, using piskel to make a still, left, and right animation to insert as an actor into Stencyl.
      <a href='code/module5.js' target='_blank' >Here</a> is a link to my actor.
