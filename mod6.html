      I have finished practicing with JavaScript via quizzes online and I have also moved on to do my own programming.
      Using the website "Code School" I have finished the basic learning path with JavaScript coding.
      I have also tested codes with JavaScript and changing up the style format of pages with the chrome developer tools.
      I continue to use my knowledge by expanding my ability to code and continuing to experiment more in JavaScript.
      I even moved onto making a canvas with inspect element in google chrome, making my own image via commands.
      <a href='code/canvas.js' target='_blank' >Here</a> is a link to the steps for a black canvas.

    <p>
      This video shows how I made the image.
