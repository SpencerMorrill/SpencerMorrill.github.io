      I have been practicing with JavaScript via quizzes online and now have also moved on to helping classmates. Using the website "Code School" I have continued my learning with JavaScript coding. I have also helped others with their modules, becoming more familiar with scripting. I continue to use my knowledge by helping others succeed in the class and helping myself succeed in learning.
      <a href='code/module2.js' target='_blank' >Here</a> is a list of people I have helped with Modules.
