    <h1>Module 1</h1>
    <p>
      I have been practicing with JavaScript via quizzes online. Using the website "Code School" I have started my intro into JavaScript coding. So far, I have learned very basic commands with JavaScript, like adding variables in the terminal. I have used this kill in class by actually applying it to my Mid-Term to help understand how to do complex equations in terminal. I continue to se this knowledge by saving the information to help further my studies into JavaScript.
